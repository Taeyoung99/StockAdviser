# StockAdviser
An app that recommends stocks in good financial position.

Also helps the user to finalize the decision by getting the relevant news for that certain stock.

Different recommendations depending on the user preference("Ask things like what kind of investor they are(How much returns do you want? Within what time frame?"

When asking those questions, give users realistic values(such as returns within certain time frame).

Make a formula using "The intelligent investor"(And other books but for now only 1.) to see if the company is overvalued, undervalued, in a good financial position, if they can 
generate profit etc(Factors to think about later).

When users input their pesonal preference, put more weight on the logic they prefer(For example, if they're risky investors, put more weight on annual returns and make model or formula based on that)

3 outcomes from user preference. Passive, Standard, Risky
